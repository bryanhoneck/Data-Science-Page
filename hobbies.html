        <h2> Hobbies/Extracurriculars </h2>
        <p> Here are some of my hobbies and other things I enjoy doing in my free time outside of class or work. This list is just to give you a sense of who I am and what I enjoy! </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Astronomy:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            I enjoy astronomy because there are so many unknowns. There are plenty of things in space to see, and there 
                            is always something new to learn - much like the field of data science.
                            In here I have included some of my telescopes and some photos I have taken.  
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The brand of this one is Saturn, which is/was made by the more popular brand Meade. It has 70mm of aperture, giving it over 3,800 square mm of light gathering capabilities. I have used this 
                            scope to get fantastic views of the moon. Here's what this scope looks like:

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Another telescope I have enjoyed over the years is this Galileo that my mom gave to me as a gift. It's aperture is 80mm, a slight upgrade from the other one. 
                            This one has produced my best view of Saturn, Jupiter, and the Moon yet! In this photo, this telescope is on the left. On the right is my newest telescope. 
                            It is a Newtonian Reflector, with 130mm of aperture. The views through the eyepiece are incredible on this one.
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Here are some other photos I have captured through the 80mm telescope with an iPhone 8. The first image is my best of Saturn thusfar. The second image is of the conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in 2020 - an incredibly rare event.

                            In December 2020, I read <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Relativity</span>, written by Albert Einstein, on his General and Special Theory of Relativity. The 
                            book was fascinating to read because it gives the reader a whole new perspective on the universe. One of my favorite astronomers, Phil Plait, once said, 
                            "Astronomy will put you in your place," and it could not be more true.

                            I have played sports my entire life. Specifically, I played soccer competitively from Kindergarten through 10th grade, football
                            from 8th grade through freshman year of college, and most other sports recreationally at least for a couple years each!
