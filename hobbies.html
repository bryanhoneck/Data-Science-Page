    <h2> Hobbies/Extracurriculars </h2>
    <p> Here are some of my hobbies and other things I enjoy doing in my free time outside of class or work. This list is just to give you a sense of who I am and what I enjoy! </p>

        <li>
            Astronomy:

                    <p>
                        I fell in love with astronomy as a kid, but how could someone not? My dad would haul our small refractor telescope out to the edge of the driveway to get 
                        views of the moon. The brand of this one is Saturn, which is/was made by Meade. It has 70mm of aperture, giving it over 3,800 square mm of light gathering capabilities. I have used this 
                        scope to get fantastic views of the moon. Here's what this one looks like:

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Another telescope I have enjoyed over the years is this Galileo that my mom gave to me as a gift. It's aperture is 80mm, a slight upgrade from the other one. 
                        This one has produced my best view of Saturn, Jupiter, and the Moon yet! In this photo, this telescope is on the left. On the right is my newest telescope 
                        that I still have much to explore with.

                        Here are some other ones photos I have captured through the 80mm telescope:
