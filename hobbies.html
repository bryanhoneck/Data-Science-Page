    <h2> Hobbies/Extracurriculars </h2>
    <p> Here are some of my hobbies and other things I enjoy doing in my free time outside of class or work. This list is just to give you a sense of who I am and what I enjoy! </p>

        <li>
            Astronomy:

                    <p>
                        I fell in love with astronomy as a kid, but how could someone not? My dad would haul our small refractor telescope out to the edge of the driveway to get 
                        views of the moon. The brand of this one is Saturn, which is/was made by Meade. It has 70mm of aperture, giving it over 3,800 square mm of light gathering capabilities. I have used this 
                        scope to get fantastic views of the moon. Here's what this one looks like:

                    <img src="images_pdfs/telescope_1.jpg" alt="My first telescope." style="border-radius: 3%; width: 25%; height: 25%;">
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Another telescope I have enjoyed over the years is this Galileo that my mom gave to me as a gift. It's aperture is 80mm, a slight upgrade from the other one. 
                        This one has produced my best view of Saturn, Jupiter, and the Moon yet! In this photo, this telescope is on the left. On the right is my newest telescope 
                        that I still have much to explore with.

                    <p>
                        Here are some other photos I have captured through the 80mm telescope with an iPhone 8. The first image is of the conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in 2020 - an incredibly rare event.

                    In December 2020, I read <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Relativity</span>, written by Albert Einstein on his General and Special Theory of Relativity. The 
                    book was fascinating to read because it gives the reader a whole new perspective on the universe. One of my favorite astronomers, Phil Plait, once said, 
                    "Astronomy will put you in your place," and it could not be more true.
