    <h1>Bryan Honeck: Data Scientist</h1>
    <p>This is a collection containing most of my projects that I have worked on to further my education in data science and machine learning. I have worked on most of these projects for purposes outside
      the classroom, but others have been used in a course such as Probability and Statistics. I put this site together in order to present my works in a format that is readily available for those interested.
      As I progress and build more projects, I plan to add them to the project list tab accordingly. 
    </p>    

    <h2> Purpose </h2>
    <p>
      I am an upcoming graduate from Ouachita Baptist University with a Bachelor's degree in both Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. I have a passion 
      for solving data science problems by visualizing data, implementing machine learning algorithms, and reporting on observations that could help tell a story that lies
      within data. I enjoy learning new skills and applying them to my school and work life. I look forward to meeting and working with others who share the same passion for 
      data science as I advance my career in the field.
