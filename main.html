    <h1>Bryan Honeck's Data Science Webpage</h1>
    <p>This is my webpage containing most of my projects that I have worked on to further my education in data science outside of the classroom. 
        For some of these projects, I was able to use them in the case that a professor assigned a generic homework or project involving data analysis.
