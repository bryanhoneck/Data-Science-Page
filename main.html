    <h1>Bryan Honeck: Data Scientist</h1>
    <p>This is a collection containing most of my projects that I have worked on to further my education in data science outside of the classroom. 
        A handful of these projects were designed for use in classes such as Probability and Statistics, PIC Math, and Differential Equations.
    </p>    

    <h2> Purpose </h2>
    <p>
      I am an upcoming graduate from Ouachita Baptist University with a Bachelor's degree in both Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. I have a passion 
      for solving data science problems by visualizing data, implementing machine learning algorithms, and reporting any observations that could help tell a story that lies
      within the data. I enjoy learning new skills and applying them to my school and work life. I look forward to meeting others who share the same passion for 
      data science as I advance my career in the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have built this site to present some of my work in a form that is readily available for those interested. As I progress and build more projects, I plan to add them 
      to the project list tab accordingly. 
    </p>
