    <h1>Bryan Honeck's Data Science Webpage</h1>
    <p>This is my webpage containing most of my projects that I have worked on to further my education in data science outside of the classroom. 
        A handful of these projects were designed for use in classes such as Probability and Statistics and PIC Math.

    <p>This data was taken from a fictional problem located on Kaggle.
        The problem involves a businessman who is attempting to start up his own phone company. He has been
        gathering data on thousands of different types of phones over the years. His goal is to be able to predict what price
        range a phone is in given the remaining 20 attributes listed in the structure of this data frame (i.e. battery capacity, phone weight, RAM, etc.).
