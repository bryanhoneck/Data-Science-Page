        <h1>Bryan Honeck: Data Scientist</h1>     
        <p>This is a collection containing most of my projects that I have worked on to further my education in data science and machine learning. I have worked on the majority of these projects for purposes outside of
          the classroom. I put this site together in order to present my works in a format that is readily available for those interested.
          As I progress and build more projects, I plan to add them to the project list tab accordingly.  
        </p>    

        <h2> Purpose </h2>
        <p>
          I am an upcoming graduate from Ouachita Baptist University with a Bachelor's degree in both Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. I have a passion 
          for solving data science problems by visualizing data, implementing machine learning algorithms, and reporting observations that could help tell a story that lies
          within data. I enjoy learning new skills and applying them to my school and work life. I look forward to meeting and working with others who share the same passion for 
          data science as I advance my career in the field.
        </p>

              I am reading <em>An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R</em> by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani. This book 
              teaches the fundamentals for using machine learning algorithms in R. It covers Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines, KNN, K-Means, and more.

              Progressing through a Probability and Statistics for Data Science and Business course on Udemy, taught by Jose Portilla. Up to this point, the course has covered several 
              different types of distributions (i.e. Poisson, Uniform, Normal), and it has covered some basic principles in Probability such as the Law of Total Probability, Bayes Rule, etc.

              Building the list of projects on this site. Kaggle has tons of fun and interesting problems to work through. When I have free time between classes and work study, I find interesting
              problems on that site and work through them. As stated in the main heading, I intend to document my journey in data science on this page as my skills improve.
