    <h1>List of Projects:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
          Phone Data Project: <a href="images_pdfs/phone_data.pdf">View R Notebook</a>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>This data was taken from a fictional problem located on Kaggle.
                The problem involves a businessman who is attempting to start up his own phone company. He has been
                gathering data on thousands of different types of phones over the years. His goal is to be able to predict what price
                range a phone is in given the remaining 20 attributes listed in the structure of this data frame (i.e. battery capacity, phone weight, RAM, etc.).

            <li>
              <p>
              In this project, I ran the k-means clustering algorithm on the two most telling attributes and wrote a report at the very end of the notebook based on my observations.

            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Iris Data Set: <a href="images_pdfs/iris_data.pdf">View R Notebook</a>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>It's hard to find a data scientist who has never come across the Iris data set. It is a small but super important data set for learning how to implement the k-means clustering
                algorithm. In this project, I run both the K-means clustering and K-nearest neighbors algorithms. It is obvious that the K-means clustering algorithm does a very good job
                of predicting the species for each flower.
