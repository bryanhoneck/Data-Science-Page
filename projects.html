              <p>This data was taken from a fictional problem located on Kaggle.
                The problem involves a businessman who is attempting to start up his own phone company. He has been
                gathering data on thousands of different types of phones over the years. His goal is to be able to predict what price
                range a phone is in given the remaining 20 attributes listed in the structure of this data frame (i.e. battery capacity, phone weight, RAM, etc.).

              In this project, I ran the k-means clustering algorithm on the two most telling attributes and wrote a report at the very end of the notebook based on my observations.
